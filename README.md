# Shape Plotter
## Project Description 
This project implements a simple Shape Visualizer that allows users to create and visualize different shapes such as Points, Lines, Circles, Triangles, Rectangles, Squares, and Polygons. The coordinates for these shapes are stored in a .dat file (shapes.dat) that can be used for further visualization with tools like Gnuplot.
